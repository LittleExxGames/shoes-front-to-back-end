Project with the combined backend and frontend. 
For front end:
cd into 'frontend/shoes-front-end'
'npm install'
then do 'npm run start'

For backend:
cd into into 'backend'
'npm install'
create the needed redis images in docker with 'docker-compose up'
then 'npm run dev'

This project was connected into AWS and hosted(at least the helloWorld in the backend was)
